## Usage
- Run the Starlife-Game script using Python.
- The game will prompt you to guess a letter.
- Type a letter and press Enter to submit your guess.
- If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed. If not, a part of the star will be drawn.
- Continue guessing letters until you either guess the word correctly or the star drawn, resulting in a loss.

## Features
- Random Word Selectionp: The game selects a random word from a predefined list of words, ensuring a unique gameplay experience each time.
- Interactive Gameplay: Players can input their guesses via the keyboard, with the game providing feedback on whether the guessed letters are correct or incorrect.
- Visual Representation: Progressively reveals the hangman stick figure and gallows as incorrect guesses are made, providing a visual representation of the game's state.
- Difficulty Levels: Adjustable difficulty levels, allowing players to choose between easy, medium, or hard modes with varying word lengths.
- Word Categories: Option to select word categories such as animals, fruits, countries, etc., adding variety and thematic coherence to the game.
- Score Tracking: Keeps track of the player's score based on the number of incorrect guesses made and the time taken to guess the word.
