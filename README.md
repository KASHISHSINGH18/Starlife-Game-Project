## Usage
- Run the Starlife-Game script using Python.

- Type a letter and press Enter to submit your guess.
- If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed. If not, a part of the star will be drawn.
- Continue guessing letters until you either guess the word correctly or the star drawn, resulting in a loss.

## Features
